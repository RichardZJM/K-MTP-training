#MECH 461 Research Notebook

##Introduction
This is the research notebook for the dataset generation of moment tensor potentials (MTP) for potassium, and the subsequent application in molecular dynamics simulations. Included is a week-by-week breakdown of the progress and findings of each session.

##Week 1
On the first week, consisted primarily of setup and understanding the MTP techniques used in the machine learning model. I started by meeting, Hao Sun, a post-doctorate student who is part of the Nuclear Materials group. His prior work involved the training of an MTP potential and thus his experience would be invaluable.
